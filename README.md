# file-edit
A short shell script that appends text to a file. It automatically creates the file you specified if the file did not exist. You can choose to erase the file before appending the text if you want  to start from scratch. You can view file contents and append text. I realized that simple file or text editors are rare, and an open-source Terminal editor would be very useful because there could be many custom versions.
